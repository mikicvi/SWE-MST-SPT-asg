# SWE-MST-SPT-asg

Assignment for TUD Comp Sci - Software Engineering 2

## List of Algorithms implemented in this project


- Minimum Spanning Tree - Prim's Algorithm and Kruskal's Algorithm
- Shortest Path Tree - Dijkstra's Algorithm	
- Depth First Search
- Breadth First Search


## How to run the project
Just commpile the individual files and run them.
- e.g 'javac GraphLists.java' and then 'java GraphLists' -> this will run the GraphLists.java file that contains everything but Kruskal's Algorithm
